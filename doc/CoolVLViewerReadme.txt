3.- Privacy policy:

No data whatsoever is collected or sent to the author of this viewer. Data is
however stored on your hard disk and exchanged with the servers of the grid(s)
you connect to, in the exact same way as an official Second Life viewer would

knowledge and understanding, and baring any unknown and yet to discover bug,
this viewer is compliant with the Third-Party Viewers policy as published by
Linden Lab (http://secondlife.com/corporate/tpv.php) at the time this
particular viewer build was released (see above about your responsibility
regarding update checks).

As a user of this viewer, you must also comply with Linden Lab's Third-Party
Viewer policy when you connect with this viewer to the Second Life grid, and I
will take no responsibility whatsoever for any bugs or shortcomings that you
would abuse or exploit in any way to violate the TOS of any grid you connect
to, or to violate the TPV policy of Second Life.
